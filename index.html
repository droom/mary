		<h2>Get the lowdown</h2>
		<p>Dividing my time between London and Bristol, I work alongside content strategists, UX folk, creative directors, brand and marketing managers to craft words and experiences that inform, entertain and convince.</p> 
		<p>And because words are only as effective as the thinking behind them, I also help brands define their positioning and their tone of voice. Did I mention I also run tone of voice training workshops? Handy things, those.</p>

		<h2>My words at work</h2>
		<p>From tone of voice development. To concepting. And straight-up copywriting.</p>
		<p>A strategy-driven, idea-generating brand storyteller. What about ad concepts, websites, brochures, emailers, packaging? Yep, yep. Blogs, articles, white papers and other content marketing materials? You're in the right place. Tone of voice development and brand positioning? Bread and butter. </p>

		<h2>Who I've worked with</h2>
		<p>Big brands, little brands. Local agencies, global ones &mdash; and even some across the pond. Below are just a few folks I've written for.</p>
		<p>I've worked at some of the UK's largest copywriting agencies where I wrote in every conceivable tone of voice and medium. I then combined my love of techy awesomeness with words in a top 100 digital agency. Which pretty much brings us up to date. Need a copywriter / storyteller?</p>
